## 🎨 Coding Standards

### Java Code Style

- **Java Version**: Use Java 17 features where appropriate
- **Naming**: Follow Java naming conventions
  - Classes: `PascalCase` (e.g., `NeuralNetwork`)
  - Methods/Variables: `camelCase` (e.g., `trainModel`)
  - Constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `MAX_ITERATIONS`)
- **Package Structure**: Use `com.aiprogramming.chXX` for chapter code
- **Documentation**: Include Javadoc for public methods
- **Logging**: Use SLF4J for logging

### Code Example Guidelines

- **Clarity**: Code should be educational and easy to understand
- **Comments**: Include explanatory comments for complex logic
- **Error Handling**: Include proper exception handling
- **Performance**: Consider performance implications
- **Real-world**: Use realistic examples and datasets

```

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- **Coverage**: Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- **Naming**: Test class names should end with `Test`
- **Framework**: Use JUnit 5 and AssertJ
- **Structure**: Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

### Example Test Structure

```java
@Test
@DisplayName("Should correctly classify positive sentiment")
void shouldClassifyPositiveSentiment() {
    // Arrange
    String text = "This is a great product!";
    SentimentAnalyzer analyzer = new SentimentAnalyzer();
    
    // Act
    String result = analyzer.analyze(text);
    
    // Assert
    assertThat(result).isEqualTo("positive");
}
```
