## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- **Coverage**: Aim for at least 80% code coverage
- **Naming**: Test class names should end with `Test`
- **Framework**: Use JUnit 5 and AssertJ
- **Structure**: Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

### Example Test Structure

```java
@Test
@DisplayName("Should correctly classify positive sentiment")
void shouldClassifyPositiveSentiment() {
    // Arrange
    String text = "This is a great product!";
    SentimentAnalyzer analyzer = new SentimentAnalyzer();
    
    // Act
    String result = analyzer.analyze(text);
    
    // Assert
    assertThat(result).isEqualTo("positive");
}
```
